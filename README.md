1. Project Setup and Database (SQLite)

    We'll set up a new Rust project and configure SQLite using SQLx.
    We'll define the database schema for users and tasks.

2. Axum Backend

    We'll create an Axum server to handle API endpoints.
    We'll implement routes for:
        User authentication (register, login, logout)
        Task management (create, read, update, delete)

3. Leptos Frontend

    We'll build a Leptos UI for the task management application.
    This will include components for:
        Authentication forms
        Task lists
        Task editing

4. Authentication

    We'll implement user authentication using a library like jsonwebtoken for creating and verifying tokens.
    We'll protect task-related routes to ensure only authenticated users can access them.
    access them.

5. Connecting Frontend and Backend

    We'll use leptos_axum to integrate the Leptos frontend with the Axum backend.
    We'll handle API calls from Leptos components to the Axum server.
